Blogverse is a full-featured MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack Blog Application. It provides a platform for users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, as well as interact with other users' content.

## Description

Blogverse is built using the following technologies:
- Frontend: React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB with Mongoose
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
